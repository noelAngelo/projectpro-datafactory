# Project Pro - Data factory + Databricks (end-to-end)

This project aims to implement Analytics/Insights on the trip transaction and ride-based source data from SQL Server, utilizing a combination of Azure Data Factory (ADF), Azure Blob Storage (ADLS Gen2), and Azure Databricks, in accordance with a Medallion Architecture approach. The project entails data ingestion into a Bronze Zone, data transformation through Azure Databricks, and data loading into Delta tables for the Gold Zone. Moreover, we plan to create a pipeline and schedule it using Azure Data Factory and leverage Logic Apps for pipeline resiliency in order to trigger emails.
